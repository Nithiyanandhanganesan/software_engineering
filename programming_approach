Computer History:
===================
1800 = charles babbage [ difference engine]
ada byron = first programmer.
1930 -40 : electronic computer prototype built[eniac]
1971 - first microprocessor

Programmer writes source code.
computer understands only object code.
Compiler converts source code into object code.
source code => compiler => class file => linker => jar => JVM => output (java)


Programming basic:
=====================
In a programming language, function represents certain action.
Let's take robot example,
move();
turnLeft();
pickBeeper();
putBeeper();
Above are the action done by robot. So, they are typically a function in programming language.

Our program has to more generic. Not stick to specific problems.


Common Errors:
================
- unconditional/infinite loop.
- off by one bug [ last iteration in loop]

precondition & post condition should be clearly specified.


Decompose the requirement:
=============================
eg: daily activities

wokeup
brushteeth
    - getToothBrush
    - toothPaste
    - moveOnTeeth
bathroom
    - takeSoap
    - washBody
shower
    - OpenTap
    - CloseTap
clothes

This design is called as top down design.
